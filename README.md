# python-challenge

**Background**

For this challenge, I was tasked with two different python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank, I was given financial records to analyze a company's profits and losses. My Python script had to analyze the records and calculate: the total number of months in the data set, the net total amount of profit/losses, over the entire period, the changes in profit/losses over the entire period in order to find the average of the changes, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses. The final script had to print the analysis to the terminal and export the results as a text file. In PyPoll, I was given poll data from a small, rural town in order to help in the voting process.
My Python script had to analyze and calculate: the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.  The final script had to print the analysis to the terminal and export the results as a text file.
